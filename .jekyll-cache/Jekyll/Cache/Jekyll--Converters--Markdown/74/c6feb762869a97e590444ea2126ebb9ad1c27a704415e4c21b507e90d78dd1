I"Ï<p>Jekyll (and Jekyll themes) is a great way to get started with Blogging. I have already been hosting a static homepage for myself using GitHub pages (at georgetipton.com), and wanted to create a blog without it being hosted on the root of my site (accessible via https://georgetipton.com/blog, for example). I had a surprisingly difficult time figuring out a way to easily accomplish this, so I figured I would create a quick how-to as my first blog entry!</p>
