# Introduction

Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE) is a powerful open-source virtualization platform that combines two virtualization technologies: KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for virtual machines and LXC (Linux Containers) for lightweight container-based virtualization. Monitoring your Proxmox environment is crucial for ensuring its reliability and performance. In this guide, we'll explore how to set up automated Proxmox monitoring and alerting to keep your virtual infrastructure in check.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. A Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE) installation.
2. Access to the Proxmox web interface.
3. A server or virtual machine running an operating system that supports Docker.

# Step 1: Install Docker and Docker Compose

Proxmox monitoring and alerting can be simplified by using Docker containers. Start by installing Docker and Docker Compose on a server or VM that can communicate with your Proxmox host. You can follow the official Docker installation instructions for your chosen operating system.

# Step 2: Create a Docker Compose Configuration

Create a directory for your Proxmox monitoring configuration files. Inside this directory, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    container_name: prometheus
    ports:
      - 9090:9090
    volumes:
      - /path/to/prometheus-config:/etc/prometheus
    command:
      - "--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml"

  alertmanager:
    image: prom/alertmanager
    container_name: alertmanager
    ports:
      - 9093:9093
    volumes:
      - /path/to/alertmanager-config:/etc/alertmanager
    command:
      - "--config.file=/etc/alertmanager/config.yml"
```

Replace /path/to/prometheus-config and /path/to/alertmanager-config with the paths to your configuration directories.

# Step 3: Configure Prometheus

Create a prometheus.yml file inside your /path/to/prometheus-config directory with the following content:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "proxmox"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["proxmox-host-ip:9100"]
```

Replace 'proxmox-host-ip' with the IP address or hostname of your Proxmox host.

# Step 4: Configure AlertManager

Create a config.yml file inside your /path/to/alertmanager-config directory. Here's a sample configuration for AlertManager:

```yaml
route:
  group_by: ["alertname"]
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 1h
  receiver: "default"

receivers:
  - name: "default"
    email_configs:
      - to: "your-email@example.com"
```

Configure the email recipient address in the to field.

# Step 5: Start Docker Containers

Navigate to the directory containing your docker-compose.yml file and run the following command to start Prometheus and AlertManager in Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

# Step 6: Configure Proxmox Alerts

In the Proxmox web interface, navigate to "Datacenter" > "Nodes" > "Your Node" > "System" > "Email." Set up email notifications, and configure alerts to send emails to your AlertManager.

# Conclusion

Automated Proxmox monitoring and alerting using Docker containers, Prometheus, and AlertManager ensures that your Proxmox virtual environment stays healthy and responsive. You can receive timely alerts about system health and take proactive measures to maintain a reliable virtual infrastructure. Monitoring and alerting are essential components of managing your Proxmox VE effectively, ensuring your virtual machines and containers run smoothly.
